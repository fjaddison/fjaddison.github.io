##Julian Addison's Portfolio
An ongoing project to build an online portfolio for my future web development endeavors.
###Getting Started
In order to see and work with my code on your local machine, follow this [**link**](https://github.com/fjaddison/fjaddison.github.io) and fork and clone the repository.
###Testing Code
This code was validated using [**W3C's**](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) validator service. So far I'm only including HTML5 and CSS3, but will soon work on adding JavaScript which will need similar validation.
###Deployment
To deploy the result of my code, you'll need to clone my repository into your local machine, and use to the command line to access the proper directory to see how it will render in a browser:
```$ open index.html```
Or, you can follow [this link](https://fjaddison.github.io/) to the current status of my portfolio.
###Built with...
